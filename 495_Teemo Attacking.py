ðŸ”Ž Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n) for all approaches â€” each attack is processed exactly once.

Space Complexity:

Iterative: O(1) â†’ only a counter is stored.

Recursive with explicit state: O(n) â†’ recursion stack.

Pure functional recursion: O(n) â†’ recursion stack + list slicing in each call.
